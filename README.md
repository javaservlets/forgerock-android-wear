## ForgeRock Android Wear
There are two hotspots hidden on to this watch face: one) opens the OOTB companion app or two) optionally logs you in.

There is [a semi-interesting (or highly-fascinating) 9 second](./wear/wear_sdk.mov) video of all of it in action.

## ForgeRock Android SDK 
ForgeRock Android SDK is a toolkit that allows developers communicate efficiently with ForgeRock Platform and ForgeRock Identity Cloud.
